Two primary method exits for collecting and preparing data for AI modelling:

1. Labeled data - --suppose 50 images of animals are there and they also have a label of weather they are dogs or not, or labelling comments
                  on weather they are negative, neutral or positive.
                  -- models trained with labeled data are more reliable and can perform very well in real-world applications.
                
2. Unlabeled data - -- in todays time AI models learn by themselves, so using this kind is cheaper and faster.
