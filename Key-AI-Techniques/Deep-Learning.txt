It is a subset of machine learning.
It's a complex process that allows machines to learn by processing input information in stages.
It uses artificial neural networks that takes a input use hidden layers to process it and then gives the output.
There can be multiple hidden layers, increasing layers also increases the learning capacity, but the downside that it needs to be carefully managed to ensure effective learning.
